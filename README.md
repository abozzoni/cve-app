## Building the Project

To build the project and create the WAR file:

```bash
mvn clean package
```
This will generate the cve-app-1.0.war file in the target/ directory.

## Building the Docker Image  
To build the Docker image using Podman:

```bash
podman build -t cve-app .
```

## Running the Application
To run the Docker container:

```bash
podman run -d -p 8080:8080 cve-app
```

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:8080/cve-app/.

## Testing Vulnerabilities
You can use this application to test various security scanning tools like Trivy, Clair, or any other vulnerability scanners to detect the included vulnerabilities.

## Important Notes
This project is intentionally vulnerable and should not be deployed in a production environment. It is designed solely for educational and testing purposes. Use it with caution and in a controlled environment.
